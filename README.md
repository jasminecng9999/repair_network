# repair_network
Instructions needed to run my code:
1. Download Simio
2. Download jupyter/anaconda 

## Description: 
I analyzed Toner It Down, Inc. dataset to generate insight on customer requests and operational components of their printer-repair network using statistical methods such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests in order to build a model simulating their repair network--this data analysis can be found with the jupyter file. The model can also be found with the provided Simio file. By modelling the companyâ€™s repair network, I optimized the number of mechanics and vans needed for the most economical network while providing faster service than competing companies with 95% confidence. Lastly, I performed sensitivity analysis to continually upgrade and address the reliability of the model

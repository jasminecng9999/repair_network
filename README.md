# repair_network

I analyzed Toner It Down, Inc. dataset to generate insight on customer requests and operational components of their printer-repair network using statistical methods such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests in order to build a model simulating their repair network--this data analysis can be found with the jupyter file. The modelling is done in Simio.
